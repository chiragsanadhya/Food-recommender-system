# Food Recommendation System


## Overview
This repository hosts a Food Recommendation System project that suggests recipes to users based on the ingredients they have. The system uses a dataset obtained from Kaggle, which contains a wide variety of Indian food recipes with images.

The dataset is available on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kishanpahadiya/indian-food-and-its-recipes-dataset-with-images).

The primary functionality of this system is to take a list of ingredients from the user and recommend recipes that can be prepared using those ingredients. Additionally, users can select a recipe and search for similar recipes.

## Project Structure
The repository is structured as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the dataset with Indian food recipes and images.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks detailing data analysis, recommendation system development, and recipe similarity search.
- `src/`: Python source code files for data preprocessing, recommendation system development, and recipe similarity search.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the project dependencies for setting up the environment.
- `LICENSE`: The project's open-source license.
- `README.md`: The file you are currently reading.



## Usage
The Food Recommendation System allows users to:

- Provide a list of ingredients they have, and the system will suggest recipes that can be prepared with those ingredients.
- Select a recipe and search for similar recipes, offering more culinary options based on their preferences.
